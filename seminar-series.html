      <p class="paragraph-2"><p>ICBINB promotes "slow science", pushes back against "leaderboard-ism", revalues unexpected negative results, and helps people push their research when "stuck". More broadly, our moon-shot is to <strong>transform how we do research by</strong>&nbsp;<strong>cracking-open the research process and inviting meta-dialog</strong>. Starting in February 2022, we will be hosting virtual seminar series monthly for promoting such values and sharing stories from or about research.</p>

<p>The <strong>ICBINB Monthly Seminar Series</strong> seeks to shine a light on the "stuck" phases of research. Speakers will tell us about their most beautiful ideas that didn't "work", about when theory didn't match practice, or perhaps just when the going got tough. These talks will let us peek inside the file drawer of unexpected negative results and peer behind the curtain to see the real story of how real researchers do real research.<br>Do you have somebody in mind who has something to say on these topics? You are very welcome to nominate them <a href="https://forms.gle/1a1JGRUjgNzRAXRz9" data-type="URL" data-id="https://forms.gle/1a1JGRUjgNzRAXRz9">here</a>.</p>

<p>Join us again for our seminar series in 2023. <em><strong>Due to a time conflict we will not have a lecture in March</strong></em>!</p>

	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Date:</b> June 1st, 2023 at 10am EDT/4pm CEST</p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6">[<a href="https://youtu.be/PHHLq9QdeGA">recording</a>]</p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Giant neural networks have taken the world by storm. These neural networks are first pretrained using self-supervision strategies to soak up knowledge about common patterns in huge unlabeled datasets, and can then be fine-tuned to solve specific problems using small amounts of task-specific supervision. We might say that the pretrained model implicitly expresses a strong prior on what kinds of patterns are relevant, which implies that the ideal fine-tuning process must be some form of Bayesian inference! But it turns out that operationalizing this insight is harder than it sounds. I’ll discuss one of our explorations in this direction in which, with a fair amount of thought, work, specialized expertise, and extra computation, we were able to use Bayesian inference to get results that were…almost as good as just fine-tuning using gradient descent. Along the way, we (re)learned some lessons about prior specification, sparsity, random-matrix theory, and the naive genius of gradient descent.

	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Title: What’s in a Graph?</b> </p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Date:</b> May 4th, 2023 at 10am EDT/4pm CEST</p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6">[<a href="https://youtu.be/dfXsjuLJ2kA">recording</a>]</p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Graph learning is one of the most rapidly-growing subfields of machine learning research. With a deluge of different architectures available, one may get the impression that *anything* can be modelled as a graph. However, for some data sets, it turns out that structural features are not driving predictive performance, and the existence of edges may not even be beneficial for generalisation. These puzzling findings lead me to ponder new directions for our field and raise awareness about *how* we work with data.
