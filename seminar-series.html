      <p class="paragraph-2"><p>ICBINB promotes "slow science", pushes back against "leaderboard-ism", revalues unexpected negative results, and helps people push their research when "stuck". More broadly, our moon-shot is to <strong>transform how we do research by</strong>&nbsp;<strong>cracking-open the research process and inviting meta-dialog</strong>. Starting in February 2022, we will be hosting virtual seminar series monthly for promoting such values and sharing stories from or about research.</p>

<p>The <strong>ICBINB Monthly Seminar Series</strong> seeks to shine a light on the "stuck" phases of research. Speakers will tell us about their most beautiful ideas that didn't "work", about when theory didn't match practice, or perhaps just when the going got tough. These talks will let us peek inside the file drawer of unexpected negative results and peer behind the curtain to see the real story of how real researchers do real research.<br>Do you have somebody in mind who has something to say on these topics? You are very welcome to nominate them <a href="https://forms.gle/1a1JGRUjgNzRAXRz9" data-type="URL" data-id="https://forms.gle/1a1JGRUjgNzRAXRz9">here</a>.</p>

<p>Join us again for our seminar series in 2023. <em><strong>Due to a time conflict we will not have a lecture in March</strong></em>!</p>

	  <p class="paragraph-6">[<a href="https://youtu.be/PHHLq9QdeGA">recording</a>]</p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Giant neural networks have taken the world by storm. These neural networks are first pretrained using self-supervision strategies to soak up knowledge about common patterns in huge unlabeled datasets, and can then be fine-tuned to solve specific problems using small amounts of task-specific supervision. We might say that the pretrained model implicitly expresses a strong prior on what kinds of patterns are relevant, which implies that the ideal fine-tuning process must be some form of Bayesian inference! But it turns out that operationalizing this insight is harder than it sounds. I’ll discuss one of our explorations in this direction in which, with a fair amount of thought, work, specialized expertise, and extra computation, we were able to use Bayesian inference to get results that were…almost as good as just fine-tuning using gradient descent. Along the way, we (re)learned some lessons about prior specification, sparsity, random-matrix theory, and the naive genius of gradient descent.

	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Graph learning is one of the most rapidly-growing subfields of machine learning research. With a deluge of different architectures available, one may get the impression that *anything* can be modelled as a graph. However, for some data sets, it turns out that structural features are not driving predictive performance, and the existence of edges may not even be beneficial for generalisation. These puzzling findings lead me to ponder new directions for our field and raise awareness about *how* we work with data.

	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Increasing evidence shows that flaws in machine learning (ML) algorithm validation are an underestimated global problem. Specifically, chosen performance metrics do not necessarily reflect the domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To break such historically grown poor practices, we followed a multidisciplinary cross-domain approach that enabled us to critically question common practice in different communities and integrate distributed knowledge in one common framework.
This talk will comprise two parts. The first part will cover common and rare pitfalls of metrics in the field of image analysis, which have been compiled by a large multidisciplinary international consortium in a community-powered process. The second part will present Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive framework guiding researchers towards choosing metrics in a problem-aware manner. A specific focus will be put on recommendations that go beyond the current state of the art.

	  <p class="paragraph-6">[<a href="https://youtu.be/tgaORWsTeTo">recording</a>]</p>
	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> The finding of the connection between the Gaussian process and deep Bayesian neural networks in the wide limit increased the interest in research on Bayesian neural networks. On one side, it helped to reason about existing works and their assumptions, such as Gaussian activations assumption in the Edge of Chaos effect, or tuning priors over functions to get closer to some GP. On another side, it gave a new perspective to Bayesian neural networks that lead to the study of the training dynamics through the neural tangent kernel, improvements in variational inference, uncertainty quantification, and others. <br>

However, empirically, the distance between a hidden unit distribution and a Gaussian process increased with depth for the same number of hidden units per layer. So one of the main directions became the study of the difference between finite and infinite width neural networks. <br>

We showed the sub-Weibull and Weibull-tail properties of hidden units conjecturing that hidden units are heavier-tailed with going deeper in the network. This tail description reveals the difference between hidden units’ in finite- and infinite-widths. There are also parallel works that show the full description of hidden units’ distributions through Meijer G-functions that are consistent with our heavy-tailed result. <br>

We found theoretically that the tail parameter increases linearly with depth. However, we could not observe the theoretical tail parameter empirically. At least, not that precise. In this talk, I give a retrospective on this line of work about the Bayesian neural networks. Further, I give details and possible explanations of our empirical results.

  	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> There has been a recent surge in research activity related to identifiability in generative models involving latent variables. Why should we care whether a latent variable model is identifiable? I will give some pragmatic reasons, which differ philosophically from and which have different practical and theoretical implications than, classical views on identifiability, which usually relate to recovering the “true” distribution or “true” latent factors of variation. In particular, a pragmatic approach requires us to consider how the structure we are imposing (or not imposing) on the latent space relates to the problems we’re trying to solve. I will highlight how I think a lack of precise pragmatism is holding back modern methods in challenging settings, including how aspects of my own research on identiability has gotten stuck without problem-specific constraints. Elaborating on methods for representation learning more generally, I will discuss some ways we can (and are beginning to) structure our latent spaces to achieve specific goals other than vague appeals to general AI.

  	  <p class="paragraph-6">[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMnsOeIUav0">recording</a>]</p>
  	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> In 2005, motivated by an open world computer vision application, I became interested in novelty detection. However, there were few methods available in computer vision at that time, and my research turned to studying anomaly detection in standard feature vector data. In that arena, many good algorithms were being published. Fundamentally, these methods rely on a notion of distance or density in feature space and detect anomalies as outliers in that space.<br>

Returning to deep learning 10 years later, my students and I attempted, without much success. to apply these methods to the latent representations in deep learning. Other groups attempted to apply deep density models, again with limited success. Summary: I couldn’t believe it was not better. In the meantime, simple anomaly scores such as the maximum softmax probability of the max logit score were shown to be doing very well.<br>

We decided that we had reached the limits of what macro-level analysis (error rates, AUC scores) could tell us about these techniques. It was time to look closely at the actual feature values. In this talk, I’ll show our analysis of feature activations and introduce the Familiarity Hypothesis, which states that the max logit/max softmax score is measuring the amount of familiarity in an image rather than the amount of novelty. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the only features that are learned are ones that capture variability in the training data. Hence, deep nets can only represent images that fall within this variability. Novel images are mapped into this representation, and hence cannot be detected as outliers.
I’ll close with some potential directions to overcome this limitation.

  	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Sampling from a probability distribution whose density is only known up to a normalisation constant is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. Recently, several algorithms based on interactive particle systems were proposed for this task, as an alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods or Variational Inference.
These particle systems can be designed by adopting an optimisation point of view for the sampling problem: an optimisation objective is chosen (which typically measures the dissimilarity to the target distribution), and its Wasserstein gradient flow is approximated by an interacting particle system, which can involve kernels. At stationarity, the stationarity states of these particle systems define an empirical measure approximating the target distribution.
In this talk I will present recent work on such algorithms, such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent [1] or Kernel Stein Discrepancy Descent [2]. I will discuss some recent results that highlight bottlenecks and open questions: on the empirical side, these particle systems may suffer from convergence issues, while on the theoretical side, optimisation tools may not be sufficient to analyse these algorithms. Still, I will also discuss recent empirical results that show that there is hope in demonstrating nice approximation properties of these particle systems.</p>

  	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Many of us want to work on real-world machine learning problems that matter. However, it’s really hard for us to focus on such problems because it is extremely difficult to publish applied machine learning papers in top venues. I will argue that the lack of respect for applied papers has several wide-ranging applications:
		  
		 <p class="paragraph-6"> <i>1) Benefits to Science:</i> We are unable to leverage scientific lessons learned through applications if we cannot publish them. Applications should actually be driving ML methods development. It is important to point out that applied papers <b>are</b> scientific. A boring bake-off or technical report is not a scientific applied paper. An applied scientific paper provides knowledge that is systematized and generalizes, just like any good scientific paper in any area of science.</p>

		 <p class="paragraph-6"> <i>2) Benefits to the Real World:</i> We publish overly complicated methods when simpler ones would suffice. If we could focus on solving problems rather than developing methods, this issue could vanish. <b>Much more importantly, if we actually focus on problems that benefit humanity, we might actually solve them.</b></p>

		 <p class="paragraph-6"> <i>3) Broadening our Community:</i> By limiting our top venues mainly to methodology papers, we limit our community to those who care primarily about methods development. This further limits our community to those who come from narrow training pipelines. It also limits our field to exclude those whose primary goal is to directly improve the world. A really good applied data scientist from any country should be able to publish in a top tier venue in data science or AI.</p>

		 <p class="paragraph-6"> <i>4) Freeing our Top Scientists:</i> By tying promotions of our top data scientists to publication venues that accept (essentially only) methodology, it means our top scientists cannot focus on real-world problems. This is particularly problematic if one wants to publish a data science paper in an area for which a specialized journal does not exist.</p>

		<p class="paragraph-6">My proposed fix is to have tracks in major ML conferences and journals that focus on applications.</p>

  	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Bayesian deep learning is seductive: it combines the simplicity, coherence, and beauty of the Bayesian approach to problem solving together with the expressivity and compositional flexibility of deep neural networks. Yes, inference can be challenging, but the promises of improved uncertainty quantification, better out-of-distribution behaviour, and improved sample efficiency are worth it. Or is it? In this talk I will tell a personal story of being seduced by, then frustrated with, and now recovering from Bayesian deep learning. I will present the context of our work on the cold posterior effect, (Wenzel et al., 2020) and it’s main findings, as well as some more recent work that tries to explain the effect. I will also offer some personal reflections on research practice and narratives that contributed to the lack of progress in Bayesian deep learning.

  	  <p class="paragraph-6"><b>Abstract:</b> Imagine you’ve got a bold new idea for ending poverty. To check your intervention, you run a gold-standard randomized controlled trial; that is, you randomly assign individuals in the trial to either receive your intervention or to not receive it. You recruit tens of thousands of participants. You run an entirely standard and well-vetted statistical analysis; you conclude that your intervention works with a p-value < 0.01. You publish your paper in a top venue, and your research makes it into the news! Excited to make the world a better place, you apply your intervention to a new set of people and… it fails to reduce poverty. How can this possibly happen? There seems to be some important disconnect between theory and practice, but what is it? And is there any way you could have been tipped off about the issue when running your original data analysis? In the present work, we observe that if a very small percentage of the original data was instrumental in determining the original conclusion, we might worry that the conclusion could be unstable under new conditions. So we propose a method to assess the sensitivity of data analyses to the removal of a very small fraction of the data set. Analyzing all possible data subsets of a certain size is computationally prohibitive, so we provide an approximation. We call our resulting method the Approximate Maximum Influence Perturbation. Empirics demonstrate that while some (real-life) applications are robust, in others the sign of a treatment effect can be changed by dropping less than 0.1% of the data — even in simple models and even when p-values are small.
